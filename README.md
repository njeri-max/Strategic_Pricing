# Dynamic Pricing Project
This project involves adjusting the rpice of a service or product based on real-time patterns.
Companies often need to change their pricing tactics to flexible pricing that clients can afford.
Some of the factors included are: client behaviour, market demand and competitor prices.
## Project Goal
This project targets to maximize profitability of a company by placing the pricing at a defined level that balances
supply and demand tactics. To make this possible several factors are considered;
1. Historical data on sales
2. Real-time data
3. Market demands
4. Data on costs
## Summary
The project aims to implement a predictive model and comparing the results to actual data.
To do this, a preprocessing pipeline is created with the goal of standardizing numeric and categorical data to become suitable 
for  amachine learning mode. According to the results, vehicle type is a valuable factor and therefore is of statistical significance to the model created.
